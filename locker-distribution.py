# We have following number of swags that need to be distributed to students:
# 1. 25 Tumblers
# 2. 3 small size shirt
# 3. 10 medium size shirt
# 4. 5 large size shirt
# 5. 20 backpacks
# 
# Need to have a N x M matrix where N is number of rows and M is number of columns. In each cell, the following needs to be satisfied:
# 1. Each cell is represented as a locker
# 2. Each locker needs to have a locker code that is randomly generated integers and has length 4 with minumum # or * characters
# 3. Each locker should try to have a bundle of swag items where each bundle should satisfy the following:
#   a. Each bundle should have 1 tumbler if possible as long as there are tumblers available
#   b. Each bundle should have 1 bag pack if possible as long as there are bag packs available
#   c. Each bundle should only have 1 shirt (does not matter if it is small, medium, or large) as long as there are available
# 4. Two lockers with position N = 2, M = 3 and position N = 2, M = 1 should be empty
